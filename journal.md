I actually think computers are great because it can help a students research but another i think devices are good becuase more and more we are using computers to do work or like google to look at something i think it's great help because it's are daily use plus it helps because we can check on grades or do missing work at home it can improve us in many diffrent ways but i think that's anywhere like jobs or even home i think computers are very important plus thry improve people use computers to do any thngs
