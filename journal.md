My entry Option 1 The phone law i mean it was better the way it was like if we use it in class they take it away that was fine because that was class but now they are just doing too like we can't use it during lunch they only took our phones awway because it distract but now it's luch what's it disstractig me form? some people at lunch don't ave friends some people can get bored at lunch and in the hallway i mean barely anyone puled out thier phones during passing period because we're walking but lunch? thats too much i mean im okay i don't really mind the law i guess option 2 AI i mean i think we really shouldn't use ai some are good but some are bad like if we need help maybe ask for help instead? but robots are smart so i can see why people so ai b but consquences i think we would get in trouble if teachers notice you use ai but it's whatever hontesly i wanted to join any computer class i LOVE computers sooo much i think it's because i've been doing computer my whole middle school years i've just love how codiing, computers and all that stuff works i mean my view didn't change sooo far i still hope i can learn a lot i hope to get coding and have fun and learn about computers so much

I actually think computers are great because it can help a students research but another i think devices are good becuase more and more we are using computers to do work or like google to look at something i think it's great help because it's are daily use plus it helps because we can check on grades or do missing work at home it can improve us in many diffrent ways but i think that's anywhere like jobs or even home i think computers are very important plus thry improve people use computers to do any thngs

i honestly think it's not a idea how are you going to get your paycheck but thaan again it depends on what you're doing if it's services jobs like restraunts or speking to people than i don't thnk it's a good idea what if you need experience and speaking to someone i real life they can get your mood or the way you speak but it's have to do with electronics than i really don't see it being a problem but i think it shouldn't be big in the future i think how we get money is fine and in the future probably more important you know what if prices go up you really don't need vitual job you need an actual job

the 6,7 is a meme form a song that says 6, 7 also the hand gesture i really don't know how it became big but i guess six ate seven but 
they says it as a little joke because you can refrence the song 6, 7 without knowing the mood is funny because people just bring people tend to laugh about it because you can just say "67" and than boom someone hands go up and they say 6, 7 the tone is like i guess like micking form the song the way he says it because he says it in a certain tone but it just laghes, people use it when ever and where ever if they just hear 67  they immediately think of the song that says 6, 7 and like why did the song include 6, 7 we should start saying it because it's funny because it doesn't make sense

For me if i was in charge i would let the school use thier phones for luch or the hallways and if it's important like you have low blood sugar or somehing like that and you need your phone to check that's fine have your phone out and i would let the school have Macbooks becuase i like them more hey were reall cool and useful last year as for the games well i guess you can only access learning games because math,reading etc games can be useful to a person too i wouldn't go hard on the phone laww because well it's just a phone i don't even have possesson over if it's a disraction for a quick second sure but if it's not than i guess it needs to be put away, but i would make the rules less strict becuase honestly they're worried about the wrong thing who cares if girls are showing their shoulders you see skin well yeah because i have skin if shoulders are a distraction than it's you that's a distracted. but yeah that what would happened if i was in charge
